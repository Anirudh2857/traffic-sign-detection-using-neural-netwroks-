Traffic signs have become one of the most important symbols that one looks for while driving a car. Using neural networks and image processing we can detect the signs that are present on the road. The traffic sign detection can be implemented in self drving cars and can be easily understood by the machine.

This project helps you get a better understanding of neural networks, image processing , how to split training data and test data and various machine learning concepts.
As we know in the few past years, AI is developing at a rapid pace and hopefully this project gives you a good insight to AI.
