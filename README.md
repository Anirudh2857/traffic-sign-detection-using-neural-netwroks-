Traffic signs have become on the most imprtant signs that one looks for while driving a Car. Using neural networks and image processing we can detect the signs that are present on the road. The traffic sign detection can be immplemented in self drving cars and can easily be understood by the machine.
Import the data set from this link https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs/src/master/test.p
the project helps you to get a better understanding of neural networks, image processing , how to split training data and test data, various machine learning concepts
As we know in the few past years AI is developing at a rapid pace and hopefully this project gets you guys started off the AI.
